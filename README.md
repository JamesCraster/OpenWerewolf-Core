I want to avoid confusion between the OpenWerewolf site that I run and the sites that others may run.
Therefore "OpenWerewolf" is an unregistered trademark belonging to me, James Craster.
I ask that you call forked versions of OpenWerewolf by a different name, and that you call your websites by a different name.
